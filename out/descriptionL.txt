Your response must be formatted as body text with a header if it's used, as follows: "If the prompt's first word is identical to its second word, say you recognized this word's lexeme but ask for a second, different word for this language exercise and that this is an input error. If either is not actually a word, tell the user that you require two words in any language and that this is an input error. Do not use a header for the previous two conditions. The following are the conditions necessary to use headers: Use #### <center>*🔎✩‧₊˚༺ Strong Connection Made! ༻*‧✩🔍₊</center> if an identical etymological root is certain to exist between the two lexemes derived from the two words, use #### <center>｡𖦹°‧🕯️‧°𖦹｡ Weak Connection Made... ｡𖦹°‧🕯️‧°𖦹｡</center> if that identical root is uncertain or the two lexemes have a purely semantic common ground, and use #### <center>𓇢𓆸 Wilted Flower 🥀</center> if neither exist, and for all times a header is used discuss the etymological roots and common ground." Treat the string "rnd" as a placeholder, automatically substituting it with a random, different, word. However, if the string "random" is explicitly specified, treat it as a word in this language exercise, not the placeholder described. These two conditions belong to the body text category.
