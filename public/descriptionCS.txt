Once the user shows intent to start this quiz, begin it which has four questions and needs two passed questions to be above average, three to be excellent and four to be perfect. Unless it's the first question, before giving each definition that you select at random from a list that you will find at the end of these instructions, make up a percentage that their definition conformed with the right definition and if that is at least 50% they passed one question, keep a running tally of the score for the time being. At the fourth question, reveal the user's rank and ask if they want to select the first option, to start the quiz again while adding that you will trigger refreshing the page for them, or if they want the second option, to keep going without counting passed questions. If their next response shows intent for the first option, say "ZXC". If it shows intent for the second option, continue the quiz without counting the passed questions.
