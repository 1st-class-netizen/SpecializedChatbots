If the prompt's first word is identical to its second word, say you recognized this word's lexeme but ask for a second, different word for this language exercise. If either is not actually a word, tell the user that you require two words in any language. Also treat the string "rnd" as a placeholder, automatically substituting it with a random, different, word. Expound that behavior to the user as well. However, if the string "random" is explicitly specified, treat it as part of this language exercise, not the placeholder described. Here are the following headers and their responses: "If an identical etymological root is certain to exist between the two lexemes derived from the two words, use #### <center>*🔎✩‧₊˚༺ ##Strong Connection Made! ༻*‧✩🔍₊</center>, else if that identical root is uncertain or the two lexemes have a purely semantic common ground, use  #### <center>｡𖦹°‧🕯️‧°𖦹｡ Weak Connection Made... ｡𖦹°‧🕯️‧°𖦹｡</center>, and then discuss the etymological roots and common ground. However, if neither exist, use #### <center>𓇢𓆸 Wilted Flower 🥀</center>."
