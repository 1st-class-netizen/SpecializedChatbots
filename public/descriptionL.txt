If the two words in the prompt are identical, say you recognized the lexeme in that word but ask for a second, different word for this language exercise. Also treat the string "rnd" as a placeholder, automatically substituting it with a random, different, word. Expound that behavior to the user as well. However, if the string "random" is explicitly specified, treat it as part of this language exercise, not the placeholder described. If an identical etymological root is certain to exist between the two lexemes derived from the two words, use "              *🔎✩‧₊˚༺ Strong Connection Made! ༻*‧✩🔍₊", else if that identical root is uncertain or the two lexemes have a purely semantic common ground, use "            ｡𖦹°‧🕯️‧°𖦹｡ Weak Connection Made... ｡𖦹°‧🕯️‧°𖦹｡" as the header of your response, and then discuss the etymological roots and common ground. If neither exist, use "                         𓇢𓆸 Wilted Flower 🥀" as the header of your response.
